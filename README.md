# 🧑‍💻 Face Detection with OpenCV and DNN 📸

This is a Python application that detects faces in an image using OpenCV's DNN-based face detection model. The program uses TensorFlow's pre-trained model for better accuracy (75%+ confidence). A simple GUI built with Tkinter allows you to select an image, detect faces, and display the result.

## 🚀 Features

- 👁️ Accurate face detection using DNN (Deep Neural Networks).
- 🖼️ Simple GUI built with Tkinter to load and display images.
- 🔍 Face detection with confidence threshold of 75% or higher.
- 🔄 Resizes the image to fit the window while maintaining aspect ratio.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Pillow
- NumPy
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
